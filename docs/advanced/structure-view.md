# Structure View

Enhancements to the IDE's **Structure Tool Window** (++alt+7++ or ++cmd+7++).

## Private Members Filter

The plugin adds an improved filter to the Structure View that allows you to hide or show private members (symbols starting with `_`) more effectively, helping you focus on the public API of your domain modules.
