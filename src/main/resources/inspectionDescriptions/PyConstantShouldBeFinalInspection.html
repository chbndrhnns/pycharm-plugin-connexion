Reports assignments to <code>ALL_CAPS</code> constants that are not declared as <code>Final</code>.
<p>
    Constants (identified by <code>ALL_CAPS</code> naming convention) should be declared as <code>Final</code>
    to prevent accidental reassignment and to improve type safety.
</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>
FOO = 1  # Should be FOO: Final[int] = 1
</code></pre>
