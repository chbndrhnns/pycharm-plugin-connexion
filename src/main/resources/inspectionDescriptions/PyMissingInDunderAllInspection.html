<h2>Symbol not exported in __all__</h2>
<p>
    Reports public top-level symbols in a Python module that are not exported via <code>__all__</code>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a module defines <code>__all__</code>, all public classes, functions, and variables defined at
        the top level should be listed there.
    </li>
    <li>If a private module (file name starts with an underscore) lives inside a package that defines
        <code>__all__</code>, its public symbols should be re-exported via the package's
        <code>__all__</code>.
    </li>
    <li>A quick-fix is available for the module-level case to append the missing symbol name to the
        module's <code>__all__</code> list or tuple.
    </li>
</ul>
