<p>
    Toggles the visibility of a Python symbol between <b>public</b> and <b>private</b>.
</p>
<p>
    If the symbol is private (starts with <code>_</code>), the intention removes the leading underscore to make it
    public.
    If the symbol is public, it adds a leading underscore to make it private.
    All usages of the symbol are updated automatically.
